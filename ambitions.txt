a lot of inspiration from this website
https://hexed.it/

#1 data saving:
if program gets passed flag -config:nullhex='.'
the null hexadecimal (to signify 0x00 or null hex value)
gets saved to a config file so that you dont have to 
pass the flag every time the program runs

#2 editing w/ ncurses
i want to implement editing hex values through selection
by pressing enter. Taking inspiration from neovim I want 
the program to have its own command line where you can 
pass :w to write to the file.

#3 decimal and binary translations 
for the hex value the cursor is hovering over at the top
of the terminal

#4 highlighting 
highlighting of the edited and selected areas on both sides of 
reader
